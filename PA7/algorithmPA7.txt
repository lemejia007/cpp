1. create file stream object
    - open commonPasswords.dat

2. If file opens

    A. ask user for password to test
        - store user input

    B. while user input != 'quit'

        a. read the first value in file into size variable for common passwords array initialization 
        
        b.  dynamically create an array to hold common passwords
        
        c.  read common passwords from commonPasswords.dat file into common passwords array
            - close file
        
        d. compare user input value with values stored in common passwords array
            - linear search
        
        f. if user value is a value found in common passwords array
            - display position of value in common passwords array
            - notify user
            - prompt user to enter a new password value to compare
        
        g. else if password is not found in common (-1 is returned)
            - calculatePasswordEntropy();
              l = userInput.length();
              r = 94;
            - outputPasswordStrengthRating();
              if
                entropy < 25   bits --> very weak
                entropy 28-35  bits --> weak
                entropy 35-59  bits --> reasonable
                entropy 60-127 bits --> strong
                entropy 128+   bits --> very strong

3. else file could not open
    - notify user file failed to open
    - exit failure

4. notify end of program
    - return 0;
